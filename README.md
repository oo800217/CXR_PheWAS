Transparent chest radiograph foundation model enables explainable human disease profiling

Chest radiography (CXR) is an affordable, widely accessible imaging modality, yet its ability to detect diseases across the full human spectrum remains unclear. Moreover, framing AI-driven predictions in terminology familiar to radiologists may enhance clinician trust and promote adoption. This study applied a contrastively pretrained, multimodal foundation model to routine CXRs, inferring a diverse range of clinical phenotypes directly from image embeddings. Screening over 1,000 phecodes, the AI-CXR model significantly predicted more than 500 conditions, including 60 prevalent and 42 incident phenotypes that consistently achieved high performance. Beyond traditional CXR-detectable diseases, our principal finding is the AI-CXR's broad capability to forecast future cardiovascular disorders and critical illnesses. Leveraging common radiologist-curated imaging features, our explainable analyses reconstructed most cluster-level predictions with strong discrimination and pinpointed concise signature findings for each phenotype group. Together, these results establish a scalable, transferable, and transparent framework for comprehensive disease profiling from routine chest radiographs.
